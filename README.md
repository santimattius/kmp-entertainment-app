# KM Entertainment App

## Set up the environment

> **Warning**
> You need a Mac with macOS to write and run iOS-specific code on simulated or real devices.
> This is an Apple requirement.

To work with this template, you need the following:

* A machine running a recent version of macOS
* [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835)
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* The [Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14936-kotlin-multiplatform-mobile)
* The [CocoaPods dependency manager](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/native-cocoapods.html)

### Check your environment

Before you start, use the [KDoctor](https://github.com/Kotlin/kdoctor) tool to ensure that your development environment is configured correctly:

1. Install KDoctor with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

    ```text
    brew install kdoctor
    ```

2. Run KDoctor in your terminal:

    ```text
    kdoctor
    ```

   If everything is set up correctly, you'll see valid output:

   ```text
   Environment diagnose (to see all details, use -v option):
   [✓] Operation System
   [✓] Java
   [✓] Android Studio
   [✓] Xcode
   [✓] Cocoapods
   
   Conclusion:
     ✓ Your system is ready for Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile development!
   ```

Otherwise, KDoctor will highlight which parts of your setup still need to be configured and will suggest a way to fix them.
